# Olist Order Amount Forecasting 

In this session we are going to create a forecast model for oder amount o Olist Store. 
We will use data from kaggle Brazilian Ecommerce, here is the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce
but I have done to create a new dataset that we need, Ijust merge several columns using MySQL. Actually it could be
done using python, but here i want didn't do that yet.


So, the best forecast model for this time series is Exponential Smoothing with MAPE 5%.
